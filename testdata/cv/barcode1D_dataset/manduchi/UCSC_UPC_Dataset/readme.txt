/* Usage and description: */

The filenames indicate the actual UPC code represented by the barcode. In many cases, the same barcode was imaged under different viewing conditions; different instances of the same barcode are indicated with the number after the underscore.

Data set 1
xVGA images (1024x768) taken with a Nokia N95 cellphone. This device has autofocus capability, although not all images collected were properly in-focus, and some had some amount of motion blur.

Data set 2
Images taken with a Nokia N95 at a resolution of 640 x 480 and highly compressed in JPEG (with apparent coding artifacts).

Data set 3
Images at 1152 x 864 resolution taken with an older Nokia 7610 phone, with no focusing capabilities.
